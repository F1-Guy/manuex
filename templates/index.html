<h1>ManueX</h1>

<p><u>ManueX</u> is the first ever smart irrigator system for green facades that uses both real-time<br>
    weather API and sensor data. Thanks to the access to that data, it is able to, with great<br>
    precision, predict the need of the green facade to be watered with an algorithm. In the end, ManueX<br>
    also connects to a microcontroller and waters the system. On the left there is a menu that links<br>
    towards functions like checking the current weather forecast, observing the humidity sensor data,<br>
    setting the watering conditions and, last but not least, an override button that waters the plant<br>
    instantly.</p>
